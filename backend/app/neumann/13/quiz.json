        "question": "According to the 1-2% rule, what is the maximum amount you should risk on a single trade if you have a $10,000 account?",
        "options": [
          "$50-$100",
          "$100-$200",
          "$500-$1,000",
          "$1,000-$2,000"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "The 1-2% rule states you should never risk more than 1-2% of your total account on any single trade. For a $10,000 account, this equals $100-$200."
      },
      {
        "question": "If you risk 10% per trade and lose three times in a row, approximately what percentage of your capital have you lost?",
        "options": [
          "20%",
          "27%",
          "30%",
          "33%"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "Three consecutive 10% losses result in approximately 30% total capital loss, and you would need a 43% gain just to break even."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should be the ideal minimum risk-reward ratio for a trade?",
        "options": [
          "1:1 (equal risk and reward)",
          "1:2 (reward is twice the risk)",
          "1:3 (reward is three times the risk)",
          "2:1 (risk is twice the reward)"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Your potential profit should be at least twice your potential loss. This means if you risk $100, you should target at least $200 profit, allowing you to be wrong half the time and still be profitable."

          "How many trades they can execute"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "Professional traders focus on how much they can lose, while amateurs focus on how much they can make. Protecting capital is the priority."

        "question": "If you have ten consecutive losses risking 1-2% per trade, what percentage of your capital would you lose?",

          "10-20%",
          "20-30%",
          "30-40%"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "With the 1-2% rule, even ten consecutive losses only costs 10-20% of your capital, allowing for recovery with disciplined trading."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the 1-2% rule refer to?",
        "options": [
          "The maximum you can invest in a single stock",
          "Your potential loss on a single trade",
          "Your expected return per trade",
          "The commission fees you should pay"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "The 1-2% rule refers to your potential loss (the difference between entry price and stop-loss price, multiplied by shares), not the total amount you invest."

        "question": "Why is risk management considered more important than picking winning trades?",

          "It's easier to implement",
          "It protects your capital and keeps you in the game",
          "It guarantees profits",
          "It eliminates the need for analysis"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Risk management protects your capital and keeps you in the game long enough to profit from your successful trades, separating long-term successful traders from those who blow up their accounts."

      {
        "question": "What is a stop-loss order?",
        "options": [
          "A limit on how many trades you can make",
          "A predetermined price where you'll exit a losing trade",
          "The maximum loss allowed per month",
          "An order to stop trading after a certain number of losses"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "A stop-loss order is a predetermined price where you'll exit a losing trade to prevent further damage and limit your loss."

          "Keeping detailed records of all trades"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "Trading with borrowed money is not recommended. The text specifically mentions never risking money you can't afford to lose, like rent money or emergency funds."

      {
        "question": "With a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, what percentage of trades do you need to win to be profitable?",

          "At least 33%",
          "At least 50%",
          "At least 75%"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "With a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, you can be wrong half the time (50%) and still be profitable because your winners make twice as much as your losers lose."

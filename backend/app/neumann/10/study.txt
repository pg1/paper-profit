Charts are visual representations of price movements over time, and learning to read them is essential for understanding market behavior.
Candlestick charts, which originated in 18th-century Japan, are the most popular format among traders.
Each candlestick represents price action during a specific time period—it could be one minute, one hour, one day, or any interval you choose.
Each candlestick has four key data points: the opening price (where the period started), the high (the highest price reached), the low (the lowest price reached), and the closing price (where the period ended).
The "body" of the candlestick shows the range between open and close.
If the close is higher than the open, the candle is typically colored green or white, indicating a bullish (upward) period.
If the close is lower than the open, it's colored red or black, indicating a bearish (downward) period.
The thin lines extending from the body, called "wicks" or "shadows," show how far the price moved beyond the open-close range during that period.
A long upper wick suggests buyers pushed prices high but sellers drove them back down.
A long lower wick suggests sellers pushed prices low but buyers recovered them.
Reading candlestick patterns can provide insights into market psychology and potential future movements.
For example, a series of small-bodied candles might indicate indecision, while large-bodied candles suggest strong conviction.
Charts also typically show volume bars at the bottom, indicating how many shares were traded during each period—high volume confirms the strength of a price move, while low volume suggests weak conviction.
Learning to read charts helps you visualize market trends, identify patterns, and make more informed trading decisions.

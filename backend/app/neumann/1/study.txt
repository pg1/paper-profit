Investing is putting your money into something with the expectation that it will grow in value over time or generate income for you.
Think of it this way: instead of just keeping your money in a jar where it sits doing nothing, you're putting it to work. You might buy shares of a company (stocks), lend money to governments or corporations (bonds), purchase property, or put money into other assets. The goal is that later on, you'll have more money than you started with.
For example, if you buy stock in a company for $100 and the company does well, that stock might be worth $150 in a few years. Or if you buy a rental property, you earn monthly rent payments while the property itself might also increase in value.
Of course, there's always risk involved—investments can lose value too. That's why investing is different from simply saving money in a bank account, which is safer but typically grows much more slowly.

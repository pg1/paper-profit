Building a portfolio involves selecting and combining investments to match your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. 
There are different portfolio strategies suited to different objectives. Growth portfolios focus on capital appreciation—they hold stocks of companies expected to increase in value significantly, even if they don't pay dividends currently. 
These are typically younger, rapidly expanding companies in sectors like Technology or innovative Healthcare firms. 
Growth investors are willing to pay higher valuations (high P/E ratios) for the potential of substantial future gains. 
These portfolios tend to be more volatile but offer higher long-term return potential. They're generally suited for younger investors with longer time horizons who can weather market downturns. 
Income portfolios prioritize generating regular cash flow through dividends and interest payments. They hold dividend-paying stocks (often established companies in sectors like Utilities, Consumer Staples, or Financials), bonds, REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts that distribute rental income), and dividend-focused ETFs. Income portfolios are typically less volatile and provide steady cash that can be reinvested or used for living expenses. They're popular with retirees who need their investments to generate spending money or conservative investors prioritizing stability over growth. 
Balanced portfolios combine both approaches, holding a mix of growth and income investments to capture appreciation while generating some cash flow and reducing volatility. The classic "60/40 portfolio" holds sixty percent stocks for growth and forty percent bonds for income and stability. Asset allocation—how you divide your portfolio among different asset types—is often more important than which specific investments you choose. A common rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 100 or 110 to determine your stock allocation percentage (so a thirty-year-old might hold seventy to eighty percent stocks, while a seventy-year-old might hold thirty to forty percent). Your risk tolerance also matters—if market volatility keeps you awake at night, you might hold more bonds and less stocks regardless of age. Time horizon is critical too—if you need the money in three years for a house down payment, you shouldn't have it heavily in stocks because a market crash at the wrong time could devastate your plans. 
Modern portfolio construction often includes target-date funds (which automatically adjust your allocation as you approach retirement), factor investing (tilting toward specific characteristics like value or momentum), and alternative investments (like commodities or hedge fund strategies) for sophisticated investors. Rebalancing is important—periodically selling winners and buying laggards to maintain your target allocation. This forces you to "sell high and buy low" systematically. The key is choosing a portfolio strategy that matches your specific situation and sticking with it through market ups and downs rather than constantly chasing performance.

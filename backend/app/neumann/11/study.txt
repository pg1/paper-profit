Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on price, volume, or open interest that help traders identify trends, momentum, and potential reversal points.
Moving averages are among the simplest and most widely used indicators.
A simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average closing price over a specific number of periods—for example, a 50-day moving average adds up the closing prices from the last 50 days and divides by 50.
This smooths out daily price fluctuations to reveal the underlying trend.
When the price is above the moving average, the trend is generally considered bullish; when below, bearish.
Traders often watch for crossovers—when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term one (a "golden cross"), it suggests upward momentum; when it crosses below (a "death cross"), it suggests downward momentum.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and magnitude of price changes on a scale from 0 to 100.
Generally, an RSI above 70 indicates a stock might be overbought (due for a price decline), while below 30 suggests it might be oversold (due for a bounce).
However, in strong trends, RSI can remain in extreme territory for extended periods.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows the relationship between two moving averages and helps identify trend changes and momentum.
It consists of the MACD line, signal line, and histogram.
When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a bullish signal; when it crosses below, a bearish signal.
These indicators aren't crystal balls—they work best when combined with other forms of analysis and used to confirm what you're seeing in price action rather than as standalone decision-making tools.
No single indicator is right all the time, which is why experienced traders use multiple indicators together to increase their probability of success.

A stock represents a share of ownership in a company.
When a company "goes public" through an Initial Public Offering (IPO), it divides ownership into millions of shares that people can buy and sell.
If you own 100 shares of a company that has 1 million shares total, you own 0.01% of that company.
As a shareholder, you have certain rights, including potentially voting on major company decisions and receiving dividends if the company distributes profits.
Stock prices constantly fluctuate based on supply and demand—the most fundamental force in any market.
When more people want to buy a stock than sell it (high demand, low supply), the price goes up.
When more people want to sell than buy (high supply, low demand), the price goes down.
But what drives this supply and demand? Many factors: company earnings reports, news about the industry, broader economic conditions, investor sentiment, analyst recommendations, and even rumors.
A positive earnings report might cause everyone to want the stock, driving up demand and price.
A scandal might cause everyone to sell, flooding the market with supply and crashing the price.
Understanding that stock prices reflect collective opinions about a company's future value is crucial.
The market is essentially a continuous voting machine where millions of participants express their views through buying and selling decisions every second the market is open.

Stocks and bonds are the two fundamental building blocks of most investment portfolios, but they work very differently.
Common stock represents equity ownership in a company.
When you buy stock, you become a part-owner with the potential to profit in two ways: through price appreciation (the stock becoming more valuable) and through dividends (regular cash payments from company profits).
However, stockholders are last in line if a company goes bankrupt—bondholders and creditors get paid first.
Stocks are generally more volatile but offer higher long-term return potential.
Bonds, on the other hand, represent debt.
When you buy a bond, you're essentially lending money to a government or corporation.
In exchange, they promise to pay you regular interest payments (called the coupon) and return your principal when the bond matures.
For example, a ten-year government bond might pay you three percent interest annually and then return your original investment after ten years.
Bonds are generally considered safer than stocks because bondholders have priority claims on company assets, and the returns are more predictable.
However, bonds also offer lower long-term returns than stocks.
Bond prices move inversely to interest rates—when rates rise, existing bond prices fall, and vice versa.
Most financial advisors recommend holding both stocks and bonds, with the ratio depending on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
Younger investors typically hold more stocks for growth, while older investors approaching retirement hold more bonds for stability and income.

Commodities are basic goods and raw materials that are interchangeable with other goods of the same type.
They include agricultural products like wheat, corn, and coffee; energy resources like crude oil and natural gas; and precious metals like gold and silver.
Commodity prices are driven by real-world supply and demand factors.
For instance, a drought might reduce wheat supply and drive up prices, while new oil discoveries might increase supply and push prices down.
Gold and silver are particularly interesting as they're often seen as "safe haven" assets—when stock markets crash or inflation rises, investors flock to precious metals to preserve wealth, driving up their prices.
You can invest in commodities through futures contracts (agreements to buy or sell at a future date), commodity-focused ETFs, or by purchasing physical metals.
Cryptocurrency is a newer digital asset class that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other digital currencies.
Unlike traditional commodities, cryptocurrencies exist only digitally and use blockchain technology to secure transactions.
Crypto is extremely volatile—prices can swing twenty percent or more in a single day.
Some investors view it as a hedge against traditional financial systems or as "digital gold," while others see it as highly speculative.
Crypto operates twenty-four-seven unlike stock markets, and regulations are still evolving.
Both commodities and crypto can add diversification to a portfolio, but they're generally considered higher risk and should only represent a small portion of most investors' holdings, especially for beginners.

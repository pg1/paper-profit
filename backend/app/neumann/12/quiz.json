        "question": "What is a support level?",
        "options": [
          "A price level where buying pressure tends to prevent further declines",
          "A price ceiling where selling pressure emerges",
          "The company's customer service",
          "The stock's all-time high"
        ],
        "correct": 0,
        "explanation": "Support is a price 'floor' where enough buyers believe the stock is undervalued and step in to buy, preventing further price drops."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a resistance level?",
        "options": [
          "A price floor where buyers emerge",
          "A price ceiling where selling pressure prevents further increases",
          "The stock's all-time low",
          "Government regulation"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Resistance is a price 'ceiling' where selling pressure (from profit-takers or skeptics) prevents the price from rising further."

        "question": "If a stock repeatedly bounces off $50, what is $50?",

          "Support",
          "The exact fair value",
          "Meaningless"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "If a stock consistently stops falling and bounces at $50, that price level is acting as support where buyers repeatedly step in."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are support and resistance exact prices or zones?",
        "options": [
          "Always exact prices to the penny",
          "Zones or areas rather than exact numbers",
          "Only round numbers like $100",
          "They don't actually exist"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Support and resistance are better thought of as zones or areas rather than exact prices, since human behavior isn't perfectly precise."

      {
        "question": "What often happens when a stock breaks through resistance with strong volume?",
        "options": [
          "It immediately crashes back down",
          "That level often becomes the new support",
          "Trading is halted",
          "Nothing changes"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "When resistance is broken with conviction, it often 'flips' to become new support, as previous sellers become buyers at that level."

        "question": "What is the Head and Shoulders pattern?",

          "A continuation pattern",

          "A company organizational chart",
          "A volume indicator"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Head and Shoulders is a reversal pattern consisting of three peaks - a left shoulder, higher head, and right shoulder at similar height to the left."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does a Head and Shoulders pattern typically signal?",

          "Potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish",
          "Increased volatility",
          "Nothing - it's meaningless"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "A completed Head and Shoulders pattern, especially when the neckline breaks, typically signals a reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend."

        "question": "What are double tops and double bottoms?",

          "Continuation patterns",

          "Moving averages"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Double tops and bottoms are reversal patterns where price tests a level twice and fails to break through, suggesting a trend change."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes chart patterns more reliable?",
        "options": [
          "Using them on very short timeframes like 1-minute charts",
          "Seeing them on higher timeframes (daily/weekly) with volume confirmation",
          "Drawing as many patterns as possible",
          "Ignoring volume"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Patterns on higher timeframes (daily or weekly charts) with confirming volume are generally more reliable than those on very short timeframes."

        "question": "How can you identify potential support and resistance levels?",
        "options": [
          "Previous highs and lows",

          "Round psychological numbers",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "correct": 3,
        "explanation": "Support and resistance can be identified using previous price highs/lows, moving averages, and psychological round numbers where traders often place orders."

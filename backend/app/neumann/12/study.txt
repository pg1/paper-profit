Support and resistance are fundamental concepts in technical analysis that represent psychological price levels where buying or selling pressure tends to emerge.
Support is a price level where a stock tends to stop falling because enough buyers believe it's undervalued at that price and step in to buy, creating a "floor." For example, if a stock repeatedly bounces off fifty dollars, that becomes a support level—buyers see it as a good deal at that price.
Resistance is the opposite—a "ceiling" where selling pressure prevents further price increases.
If a stock repeatedly fails to break above sixty dollars, that's resistance—sellers think it's overvalued at that price or traders take profits there.
These levels aren't exact numbers but rather zones, and they can be identified using previous highs and lows, moving averages, or round psychological numbers (like one hundred dollars).
When a stock breaks through resistance with strong volume, that level often becomes the new support, and vice versa.
Chart patterns are formations created by price movements that tend to repeat and suggest potential future direction.
The Head and Shoulders pattern is one of the most reliable reversal patterns, consisting of three peaks—a left shoulder, a higher head, and a right shoulder at approximately the same height as the left.
When the "neckline" (the support connecting the lows between peaks) is broken, it signals a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish.
Other common patterns include double tops and bottoms (reversal patterns), triangles (continuation patterns suggesting the current trend will resume), and flags and pennants (short-term continuation patterns).
Recognizing these patterns takes practice, and they're more reliable on higher timeframes (daily or weekly charts) with confirmation from volume.
Understanding support, resistance, and patterns helps you identify potential entry and exit points and anticipate where a stock might find buyers or sellers.

Stock exchanges are the marketplaces where stocks are bought and sold.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization and operates with a physical trading floor where designated market makers facilitate trades.
The NASDAQ is an electronic exchange with no physical trading floor—all transactions happen through computer networks.
Each exchange has listing requirements that companies must meet to have their stock traded there.
When you want to buy or sell a stock, you place an order through your broker, who routes it to the appropriate exchange.
Understanding order types is crucial for executing trades effectively.
A market order tells your broker to buy or sell immediately at the best currently available price.
It guarantees execution but not price—if you place a market order for a volatile stock, you might get a price quite different from what you expected, especially if the stock is moving quickly.
A limit order specifies the exact price you're willing to pay (for a buy) or accept (for a sell).
For example, if a stock is trading at fifty dollars but you only want to buy it at forty-five dollars, you'd place a limit buy order at forty-five.
Your order will only execute if the price drops to your specified level.
This gives you price control but no guarantee of execution—the stock might never reach your target price.
There are also stop orders (which become market orders when a certain price is reached) and stop-limit orders (which combine features of both), useful for limiting losses or protecting profits.
Understanding these tools helps you execute your strategy more precisely.

Strategies in investing and trading are simply plans or methods that guide how you buy and sell assets to try to make money or achieve specific financial goals.

Think of a strategy as your game plan. Just like you wouldn't play chess by making random moves, you shouldn't invest or trade without some approach guiding your decisions.

In plain terms, a strategy answers questions like:

- When should I buy or sell?
- What should I look for before making a decision?
- How much money should I put into each investment?
- How long will I hold onto my investments?
- How do I know when to cut my losses or take profits?

Some common examples:

A value investing strategy means buying stocks that seem underpriced and holding them until the market recognizes their true worth. Warren Buffett is famous for this approach.

A day trading strategy means buying and selling within the same day, trying to profit from small price movements. You might use technical indicators to decide when to jump in and out.

A dollar-cost averaging strategy means investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This removes the stress of trying to time the market perfectly.

A momentum strategy means buying assets that are rising in price, betting that the trend will continue, at least in the short term.

The key is that strategies give you rules to follow, which helps you make consistent decisions rather than emotional ones. Without a strategy, you're essentially gambling rather than investing with purpose.
